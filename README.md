# ApriSi-Steam
ApriSi Steam is a WPF Program that checks what games you and your selected friends can play together.

# Why was this made
We made this project due to us always having a hard time finding out what to play together,
so we decided to create this application to check which games we both have that are co-op/multiplayer.

We decided to make this our education project and we are currently fixing up all that ugly code and making it much better.

# How do we gather information
We use web scraping to get information from SteamDB and Steam,
we also used Facepunch Steamworks to connect to the Steam Client.
